<p>The basis of the BMI was devised by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician and sociologist, 
from 1830 to 1850 during which time he developed what he called "social physics". The modern term "body mass index"
 (BMI) for the ratio of human body weight to squared height was coined in a paper published in the July 1972 edition of the
 Journal of Chronic Diseases by Ancel Keys and others. In this paper, Keys argued that what he termed the BMI was "..
.if not fully satisfactory, at least as good as any other relative weight index as an indicator of relative obesity"
The interest in an index that measures body fat came with increasing obesity in prosperous Western societies. 
BMI was explicitly cited by Keys as appropriate for population studies and inappropriate for individual evaluation.
 Nevertheless, due to its simplicity, it has come to be widely used for preliminary diagnosis. Additional metrics, 
such as waist circumference, can be more useful.
The BMI is universally expressed in kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. If pounds and 
inches are used, a conversion factor of 703 (kg/m2)/(lb/in2) must be applied. When the term BMI is used informally, 
the units are usually omitted.</p>
<p>
BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health 
professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively with their patients. 
BMI was designed to be used as a simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive) 
populations, with an average body composition. For these individuals, the current value recommendations 
are as follow: a BMI from 18.5 up to 25 kg/m2 may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the 
person is underweight, a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is overweight, and a number from 30 
upwards suggests the person is obese. Some athletes, such as football linemen, have a high muscle to fat 
ratio and may have a BMI that is misleadingly high relative to their body fat percentage.
